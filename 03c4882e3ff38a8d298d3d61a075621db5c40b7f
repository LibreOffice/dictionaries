      "message": "Hi Aleś, \n\nThis patch looks generally OK to me, see a small change request below. \n\nIf there were any discussions at other places than gerrit, I missed them. So I don\u0027t know why Roman Kuznetsov gave -2. Roman, could you please let me know?\n\nIt seems to me that this patch is not an update to the old dictionary, but a different dictionary by a different author. I\u0027d appreciate some explanation in the commit message, i.e. why the old dictionary became obsolete, and why the new is better. \n\nThe unmunch tool from hunspell crashes on the new dictionary. Surely, it is a bug in unmunch, it should not crash. But probably the bug is triggered by an error in .dic or .aff. I don\u0027t know about other methods to validate .dic and .aff. How were they generated? Is there a public repo of the source code?",

      "message": "Hi Andras.\n\nRoman and Mike said that I used wrong picture of flag for Belarus(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Belarus#White-red-white_flag). Okay, it makes sense, but all LibreOffice extensions https://extensions.libreoffice.org/?q\u003dbelarusian\u0026action_doExtensionSearch\u003dSearch use wrong flags: soviet flags. So, I just removed flag picture from package, asked for Mike to approve, but still waiting for any response.\n\nIt\u0027s really new dictionary, which is based on the new Belarusian grammar database. This database contains ~265ths paradigm and ~4.5mln wordforms. It\u0027s most complete list of words of Belarusian language for today. Dictionary for LibreOffice doesn\u0027t include all words, of course, but only words from official academic dictionaries. This database will be officially released at the beginning of October under the label of the Institute of Linguistics of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. Now, you can download very old version from https://bnkorpus.info/nkorpus-grammar.zip, but new version will be published at the https://github.com/Belarus/GrammarDB after official release. Old dictionary doesn\u0027t contain so complete list of wordforms(there are many missed words) and was based on old lists of words from different sources.\nShould I put this explanation somewhere else ?\n\nI created hunspell files by https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell/blob/master/src/tools/affixcompress script. I can send you source .add and .dic files if you want.\n\nAbout \"en -\u003e en-US\" change in the description.xml. Should I change it in the \"publisher\" tag also, and change \"be -\u003e be-BY\" ?",

What I saw was that you changed the image as I asked, and that was OK by me (but you didn\u0027t address my other concern about \"official\" term; however, that alone is not a problem by me - if it is meant to reflect that it uses some reference which has that word in name).",

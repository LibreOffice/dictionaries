THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS 
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR 
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS 
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE 
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE 
CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE 
IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and 
   other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative  
   work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic 
   work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations 
   or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted 
   including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a 
   work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for 
   the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is 
   a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work 
   in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an 
   Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as 
   encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, 
   or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) 
   below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
   constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its 
   entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, 
   each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which 
   together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a 
   Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the 
   purposes of this License.
   c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and 
   copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other 
   transfer of ownership.
   d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that 
   offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
   e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, 
   the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or 
   if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in 
   addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, 
   dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, 
   interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of 
   folklore; 
   (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal 
   entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, 
   (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the 
   broadcast.
   f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms 
   of this License including without limitation any production in the 
   literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or 
   form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet 
   and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same 
   nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or 
   entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; 
   a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a 
   process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, 
   architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to 
   which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography;
   a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or 
   three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or 
   science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to 
   the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by 
   a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered 
   a literary or artistic work.
   g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License 
   who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to 
   the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to 
   exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to 
   communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, 
   including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make 
   available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may 
   access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; 
   to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the 
   communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including 
   by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any 
   means including signs, sounds or images.
   i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including 
   without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation 
   and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected 
   performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, 
restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or 
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection 
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual 
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights 
in the Work as stated below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more 
   Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, 
   including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly 
   label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the 
   original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work 
   was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate 
   "The original work has been modified.";
   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated 
   in Collections; and,
   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
   
      For the avoidance of doubt:
         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in 
		 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or 
		 compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves 
		 the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise 
		 by You of the rights granted under this License;
         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in 
		 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or 
		 compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the 
		 exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of 
		 the rights granted under this License; and,
         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to 
		 collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the 
		 Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers 
		 voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by 
		 You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known 
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such 
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other 
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted 
by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made 
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms 
   of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource 
   Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You 
   Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms 
   on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of 
   the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that 
   recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. 
   You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the 
   disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or 
   Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You 
   may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that 
   restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the 
   rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This 
   Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
   does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made 
   subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon 
   notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from 
   the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You 
   create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent 
   practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 
   4(b), as requested.
   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or 
   Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 
   4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, 
   reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the 
   Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the 
   Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., 
   a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution 
   ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service 
   or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) 
   the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably 
   practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated 
   with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice 
   or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with 
   Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the 
   use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the 
   Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by 
   Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be 
   implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case 
   of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a 
   credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection 
   appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as 
   prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the 
   avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section 
   for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by 
   exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or 
   explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement 
   by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as 
   appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, 
   express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or 
   Attribution Parties.
   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be 
   otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or 
   Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations 
   or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other 
   derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to 
   the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those 
   jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in 
   Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be 
   deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory 
   action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the 
   Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the 
   fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You 
   to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License 
   (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR 
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY 
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER 
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT 
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, 
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT 
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. 
   Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from 
   You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated 
   provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those 
   licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of 
   this License.
   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is 
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). 
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the 
   Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at 
   any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to 
   withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required 
   to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will 
   continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, 
   the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same 
   terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor 
   offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms 
   and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under 
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the 
   remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the 
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no 
   breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and 
   signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with 
   respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements 
   or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor 
   shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any 
   communication from You. This License may not be modified without the 
   mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this 
   License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention 
   for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 
   28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, 
   the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal 
   Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and 
   subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the 
   License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding 
   provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the 
   applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under 
   applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this 
   License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; 
   this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under 
   applicable law.
